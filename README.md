Big Data Analytics in Cognitive Social Media and Literary Texts: Theory and Praxis


The book presents application of Big Data Analytics beyond the bars of the academic disciplinary research used for knowledge extraction, prediction, and decision making in the field of individual, social and national development. The book explores the knowledge of Human/Society-Technology Interface reflecting interferences of Big data analyses in Social Media and Literary Texts. The present volume gives a comprehensive overview of theory and praxis of Big Data Analytics; and how it is used to extract knowledge of cognition from Social Media and literary texts.
This volume provides a comprehensive overview of the theory and praxis of big data analytics and how it is used to extract knowledge of cognition from social media and literary texts. It presents analytics beyond the bars of academic disciplinary research used for knowledge extraction, prediction, and decision making in the field of individual, social and national development. It maximizes reader insights into the aetiology behind human cognition and its reflection across social media and literary texts. 
The book is divided into three main sections, the first of which discusses various approaches associated with big data analytics, the second addresses the security and privacy of big data on Social Media and the last section focuses on the literary text of big data. This book is suitable for those interested in analytics that can be applied in literature, history, philosophy, linguistics, and digital humanities.

The focus of the book 

Analysis of the Big data i.e. the heavy rush of data explosion, especially the unstructured one (like email conversations, social media posts, feedback, video contents, photos, voice recordings, sounds, etc.) help develop decision making, prediction, and removal of distortion resulting cracked human agencies.
